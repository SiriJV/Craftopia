You're placed on a 3x3 grid with the Enderman in the center. You must quickly choose any of the 8 surrounding squares. The Enderman will randomly turn to face one direction, and if you pick the square he's looking at, you lose a life. With only 3 hearts, every move counts. Survive as long as you can, rack up points, and see how well you can evade the Enderman's unsettling gaze."}
